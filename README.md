**|Easy automatic multi-app passive income project with Web Dashboard, Auto Updater, and Proxy Support :dollar::satisfied:|**

## üîç Quick Overview

**Money4Band (M4B)** leverages unused internet bandwidth, allowing you to make money with something you have and would otherwise be wasted. It utilizes containerized versions of apps like EarnApp, Honeygain, IPRoyal Pawns, PacketStream, Peer2Profit, Repocket, Earnfm, Proxyrack, Proxylite, Bitping, Grass, Packetshare, Gradient, Wipter and more. It's also safer than installing and using these native apps on your host system. - all managed through a single tool with:

‚ú® **Key Features:**

- **üßä Multiplatform and Lightweight** Docker stack.

- **üîÑ Automatic Updates** to keep your applications up-to-date.

- **üìä Web Dashboard** for easy monitoring.

- **üåç Multi-proxy support** for enhanced flexibility.

- **üîí Safer than installing each app directly**: Runs in isolated containers, ensuring your host system remains unaffected.

üåê For a detailed overview and FAQ join our [Discord Community](#-join-the-money4band-community-on-discord).

## üö• Getting Started

### üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- 64-bit Operating System with Docker installed and running
> üí°**Note:** Turn on the `auto-start on system boot` in Docker settings to ensure the stack starts automatically when your system boots.

> üí°**Note:** For ARM devices like Raspberry Pi, installing an emulation layer for non-ARM native Docker images is recommended. Even though the script can assist with the installation, we recommend users install an emulation layer by themselves.

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Download and Run

You can run Money4Band in two simple ways:

#### Option 1: Run from source code üîÄ

If you want to run the project from source code, you can do so by following these steps:

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è**Note:** This method requires Python 3.8 or higher.

1.  **Clone or download** the source code using one of the following methods:
    - Option A: `git clone https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band.git && cd money4band`
    - Option B: `wget https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band/archive/refs/heads/main.zip && unzip main.zip && cd money4band-main`
    - Option C: `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -OutFile main.zip; Expand-Archive -Path main.zip -DestinationPath .\ ; cd money4band*`

2.  **Install dependencies and run:** `pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 main.py`
    > üí°**Optional:** create a virtual environment to avoid affecting your system Python: `python3 -m venv venvm4b`
    > Remember to activate the virtual environment by using:
    > - (Linux/Mac): `source venvm4b/bin/activate`
    > - (Windows): `venvm4b\.Scripts\activate`

#### Option 2: Download a Pre-Built Release Artifact üì¶

You can download a pre-built release artifact for your OS and run it directly without needing to clone the repository or install any dependencies.

1. Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band/releases)
2. Download the latest release for your OS
3. Extract the downloaded release (.zip or .tar.gz) to a folder of your choice
4. Open the extracted folder and run the application:
   - **On Windows:** Run `money4band.exe`
   - **On Linux/macOS:** Run `./money4band`

> üí°**Note:** If you're using Windows and see a security warning from SmartScreen, click `"More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway"` to proceed

> üí°**Note:** If you're using Linux and see a permission error, you may need to make the script executable by running `chmod +x money4band` in the terminal

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Configuration

Follow these steps to set up and configure your Money4Band instance:

1.  **Register** for accounts on the apps you want (see table below).

2.  **Launch M4B and follow the guided setup** to configure the apps.

3.  **Start the stack** after completing the setup.

4.  **Enjoy passive Earnings** monitoring your performance through the web dashboard.

## üåê Scale Up with Multi-Proxy Support

**Money4Band** has the ability to create multiple instances also using a proxy list, ideal for scaling up your setup. Quickly set up numerous instances each linked to a different proxy with ease.

To run multiple instances using different proxies:

1.  **Prepare Proxies**: Create a `proxies.txt` file in the root folder of M4B, listing each proxy on a separate line and ending with a new line.
2.  **Start M4B and do the Setup**: During setup, answer yes when asked to enable multi-proxy.

> üí°**Note:** Proxy entries can be formatted in one of the following ways:
> - **With Authentication:** `protocol://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxy_url:proxy_port`
> - **Without Authentication:** `protocol://proxy_url:proxy_port`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è**Note:** While using multiple proxies, be aware that only certain apps permit proxy usage per their Terms of Service. We recommend using personal, private proxies with IPs not flagged as proxies and always respecting the ToS of each app.

## üß™ Compatibility and tested environments
